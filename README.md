# galaxia

Galaxia uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive web application where users can enter their birthday and discover a **unique, astronomical phenomena** that occurred on the same date. Accompanied by soft background instrumentals and visually stunning space animation, Galaxia is meant to be relaxing, fun and an overall escape from the hectic activies of every-day life.

<br/>

**Expected features:**:
[ ] Animated background images on landing page that randomize during refresh
[ ] A form that receives user birthday information and stores it as the key for a Hash table, with the value a particular astronomical event (AE)
[ ] Use Wiki's API to pull paragraphs associated with the AE 
[ ] Use Unsplash's image API to pull images associated with the AE 
[ ] Create an aesthetically pleasing response page for user's corresponding AE 
[ ] Have respective soft, twinkly instrumental pieces for landing page and response page
[ ] Have a "enter a different date" option on the response page
[ ] Have a (constant) moving background for the response page
[ ] Possibly use swup for clean page transitions and design

**Start Date**: Jun 2, 2022<br/>
**End Date**: WIP
