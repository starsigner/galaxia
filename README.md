Galaxia uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive web application where users can enter their birthday and discover a unique, astronomical phenomena that occurred on the same date. Accompanied with soft background instrumental and a visually stunning space animation, the application is meant to be relaxing, fun and an overall escape from the hectic activies of every-day life.
