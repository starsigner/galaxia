# galaxia

Galaxia uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive web application where users can enter their birthday and discover a **unique, astronomical phenomena** that occurred on the same date. Accompanied by soft background instrumentals and visually stunning space animation, the application is meant to be relaxing, fun and an overall escape from the hectic activies of every-day life.
